# Foreword

Software correctness is a cornerstone of reliable computing systems. As humanity invents and develops more sophisticated and immersive technologies, the demand for resilient software that behaves exactly as intended has become increasingly critical. We have always had systems that must never fail because their real-world side effects are irreversible by nature. For example, nuclear power plant control software should never drain coolant from a reactor, and aircraft engines must not stop under any circumstances.

The Inference project started in January 2023 to address the challenges that this new era of computing brings. With the advent of blockchain and cryptographic protocols, quantum computing, AI-managed systems, and robotics, the need for software that is provably correct and secure has never been more pressing. No one wants a household robot to decide to iron already worn clothing. Likewise, blockchain smart contract exploits cause not only financial losses but also slow the evolution of the financial system, which is particularly harmful as of the end of 2025.

Traditional testing and debugging methods, while useful, often fall short of providing absolute guarantees about program behavior. Formal Verification (FV), despite being one of the most advanced and reliable techniques for ensuring the correctness of algorithm implementations, has for decades been marginalized and used primarily in aerospace, military, and other safety-critical industries.

>Inference aims to bring Formal Verification into the software engineering mainstream.
