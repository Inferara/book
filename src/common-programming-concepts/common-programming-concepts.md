# Common Programming Concepts

This chapter covers common programming concepts that are shared across many programming languages. It does not focus on Inference-specific features. Instead, it presents Inference as a high-assurance, software-oriented programming language and introduces the core principles and syntax you need to write executables and libraries in Inference.

In this chapter, we cover data types, functions, and comments. Understanding these concepts is essential for writing programs in Inference.

> Inference keywords, data types, and other language constructs are covered in the [Language Reference](../appendix/language-reference.md) appendix.
