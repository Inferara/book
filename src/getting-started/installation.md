# Installation

To install Inference you need to download binary files for your operating system from the [`infc` GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/inference/infc/releases).

>**Command Line Notation**
>
>In this chapter and throughout the book, we'll show some commands used in the terminal. Lines that you should enter in a terminal all start with `$`. You don't need to type the `$` character; it's the command line prompt shown to indicate the start of each command. Lines that don't start with `$` typically show the output of the previous command. Additionally, PowerShell-specific examples will use `>` rather than `$`.
