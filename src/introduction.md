# Introduction

You are reading a book about _The Inference Programming Language_. With Inference, you can write highly reliable, mission critical programs with the highest level of confidence that they will behave exactly as intended. Inference is designed from the ground up to support Formal Verification (FV) of program properties, allowing to prove the code correctness mathematically without need to learn complex mathematical theories or specialized verification tools. Inference allows you to write code and its verification in the same language and even file as you used to do with unit tests.
